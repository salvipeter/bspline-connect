# BSplineConnect
Lightweight library for connecting BSpline patches with G1/G2 continuity

This uses an [approximative algorithm](http://doi.org/10.1145/1839778.1839809).

A minimal documentation is provided in the `bsconnect.hh` header file, and a simple test program with data files is also supplied.
Uses my [geometry library](https://github.com/salvipeter/libgeom/).
